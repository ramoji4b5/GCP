##Authenticate to the source project by running the following command and follow the prompts:

gcloud auth login

## Authenticate to the destination project by running the following command and follow the prompts:

gcloud auth login --project=DESTINATION_PROJECT_ID

## Set the source and destination bucket URLs as environment variables by running the following commands, replacing the placeholders with your own bucket names and project IDs:

export SOURCE_BUCKET=gs://SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME
export DESTINATION_BUCKET=gs://DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME

## Use the "gsutil" tool to copy the images from the source bucket to the destination bucket by running the following command:
gsutil -m cp -r $SOURCE_BUCKET/* $DESTINATION_BUCKET/


## To know the total number of images in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, you can use the following command with the gsutil tool:

gsutil ls -r gs://BUCKET_NAME/** | grep -c ".jpg\|.png\|.jpeg\|.gif\|.bmp"

## To remove a specific number of images from a GCS bucket using the gsutil command-line tool, you can use a combination of commands to first list the objects in the bucket, select a subset of those objects using head or tail, and then remove those objects using gsutil rm. Here is an example command to remove the first 100 JPEG images from a bucket:

gsutil ls gs://BUCKET_NAME/*.jpg | head -n 100 | gsutil -m rm -I

##To copy a specific number of images from a GCS bucket to another bucket using the gsutil command-line tool, you can use a combination of commands to first list the objects in the source bucket, select a subset of those objects using head or tail, and then copy those objects to the destination bucket using gsutil cp. Here is an example command to copy the first 100 JPEG images from a source bucket to a destination bucket:

gsutil ls gs://SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME/*.jpg | head -n 100 | gsutil -m cp -I gs://DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME/

## To list the names of images in a GCS bucket using the gsutil command-line tool, you can use the ls command with the -p or --projection=full option to include the full object name in the output. Here is an example command to list the names of all JPEG images in a bucket:

gsutil ls -l gs://BUCKET_NAME/*.jpg
